- 👋 Hi, I’m Konstantin Gizdarski and I'm currently working as a software engineer at Lyft.
- ⚒️ Prior to Lyft, I interned at Instagram and Stripe.
- 🌎 I'm originally from Bulgaria, but I grew up in Silicon Valley, went to university in Boston, and studied abroad in Beijing and London.
- 🏠 These days, I am residing in the San Francisco Bay Area.
- 🌱 I’m currently working to build state-of-the-art machine learning technology at Lyft.
- 🧠 I'm passionate about working at the forefront of technology — and being a part of teams which promote all three of impact, innovative engineering, and personal growth.
- ☀️ outside work, I enjoy being active (as a hobbyist!), meeting interesting people, and traveling the world.
- 📫 Feel free to reach me by email at kosigz@lyft.com.
