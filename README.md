- 👋 Hi, I’m Konstantin Gizdarski and I'm currently working as a software engineer.
- 🌎 I'm originally from Bulgaria, but I grew up in Silicon Valley, went to university in Boston, and studied abroad in Beijing and London.
- 👀 I’m interested in building technology and shaping companies. During that time, I got BS and MS degrees in computer science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build state-of-the-art machine learning infrastructure at Lyft.
- 🧠 My passione within software engineering is for building systems and teams that promote both building novel, lasting technology and learning and personal growth.
- ☀️ outside work, I enjoy being active (as a hobbyist), meeting interesting people, and travel.
- 📫 Reach me by email at kosigz@lyft.com.
